# Steven Saylor's Personal Site

### Project Plan

1. I'm going to make a personal resume-like site.
2. I plan on using Zurb Foundation for my front end framework.
3. I'm going to go with a single-page site in a similar manner to the class site.
4. I plan on going with a regular implementation.  If I feel like I'm going to have time to go with MVC, I'll let you know in advance.  If I do, I'll use AngularJS.
5. Are we allowed to use build tools like Grunt etc.?
